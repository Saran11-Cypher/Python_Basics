Subject: Final Submission – Multilingual Filtration & Translation Utility (with Executable & Automation Features)

Hi [Client's Name],

Hope you're doing well.

We’re pleased to submit the final deliverables for the Multilingual Excel Translation & HRL Filtration Utility, developed by the Analytics Solutions team (S&P: Analytics COE). This Django-based application is now packaged as a single executable (.exe) using PyInstaller, making it easily deployable with no setup required from the user’s side.

🔧 Key Highlights of the Application:

✅ Web Application Features (Django-Based)

Dashboard showing real-time upload stats and user activity.

User signup, login, password reset with OTP, and full admin controls.

Admins can manage user roles and access.

Role-based permissions restrict regular users from seeing others' uploads.

📁 Excel Upload & Filtration

Drag-and-drop support for .xlsx/.xls files.

Version logic: supports latest, oldest, or all HRL matches.

Excel content is cleaned and stored in JSON format in the database.

Duplicate checks and intelligent version handling.

🧪 DMT HRL Filtration

Matches config names with multi-version .hrl files (e.g., valuelist.configname.2024-01-01.a.hrl).

Auto-tags each row as HRL Found or Not Found.

Excel output includes color-coded highlights based on version count:

🔴 1 version → Red

🟢 2 versions → Green

🔵 >2 versions → Blue

Final filtered output is saved with a timestamp in the same folder.

⚡ Performance

Supports background threading and caching for fast execution.

Translates/filters over 1000+ records per minute.

Real-time progress bar with speed, ETA, and record count.

🧾 HTML Merge Automation

Upload multiple .html files and specify a batch size.

Automatically merges files into folders based on batch limits.

Output folders are timestamped and clearly named.

Ideal for bulk merging operations for archiving or ingestion.

📦 One-Click Launch with PyInstaller

Entire Django app packaged as a .exe file.

No need to install Python or dependencies.

Just double-click to run — ideal for client-side use.

📂 Output Files

Final translated or filtered Excel outputs are auto-saved in the original upload folder.

File naming follows:
<input-file>_translated_output_<timestamp>.xlsx
<input-file>_filtered_output_<timestamp>.xlsx

Let us know if you'd like a demo walkthrough, assistance with deployment, or any enhancements. We’re happy to support further use cases.

Looking forward to your feedback!

Warm regards,
[Your Full Name]
